        <p>10.6. Defects in the functionality of the Software Product that are the subject of a complaint will be verified. The Customer will be informed about the results of the investigation through the Customer&rsquo;s account available on the Company&rsquo;s web interface, by email or in writing. If the complaint is recognised as legitimate, the Customer will be provided with a free upgrade of the Software Product that addresses the defect that was the subject of the complaint.</p>
        
        <p>10.7. If it cannot be demonstrated that the defect in the Software Product was caused by the Company or if the complaint about the Software Product is unjustified, the Customer will be charged for the work associated with identifying the cause and confirming or eliminating the defects complained about by the Customer in accordance with the Price List valid at the time these tasks are performed.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>11. COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE</p>
        
        <p>11.1. The Company is not liable for any loss or damage that results from a breach of the Customer&rsquo;s obligations under the Licensing Agreement or the present GTC, or if the Customer contributed by its wrongful conduct to the loss or damage that was suffered.</p>
        
        <p>11.2. The Company is not liable for damage arising as a result of the interruption or restriction of the operation of the Software Product for the reasons stated in Art. 5.2 and Art. 5.3 of the present GTC.</p>
        
        <p>11.3. The Company is not liable for the loss or damage arising as a result of circumstances excluding liability in accordance with the applicable legal regulations. A fault in the means of remote communication (e.g. Internet connection) used by the Customer or the Company and/or a failure of any technical device not caused by the Company is also considered by the Parties to be a circumstance excluding liability of the Company.</p>
        
        <p>11.4. The Company is not liable for the loss of, or damage to, data which was not properly backed up by the Customer.</p>
        
        <p>11.5. The Company is not liable for the Customer&rsquo;s lost profits or any special, indirect, economic or consequential loss of the Customer.</p>
        
        <p>11.6. The Company is not liable for damage that does not arise directly in connection with the breach of a legal obligation on the part of the Company.</p>
        
        <p>11.7. The overall liability of the Company for damages, if any, is limited to an amount equal to the price excluding VAT paid by the Customer to the Company for the licence for the Software Product not exceeding the amount for the last twelve months of use of the Software Product prior to such a claim being raised against the Company by the Customer. The Company is not liable for any damages incurred by the Customer in connection with the Software Product in the event that the Customer uses the Software Product provided by the Company free of charge.</p>
        
        <p>11.8. The Company is not liable for late delivery of the Software Product or its non-delivery for reasons that are objectively beyond its control.</p>
        
        <p>11.9. The Customer takes note of the fact that the communication between the Company and the Customer is not encrypted or otherwise secured against disclosure to third parties unless otherwise stated in the Agreement or the present GTC. In this regard, the Company is not liable for any damage incurred as a result of unauthorised access to electronic communications between the Company and the Customer by third parties.</p>
        
        <p>11.10. The Company is not responsible for the proper delivery of an email to the email address of the Customer and it is not liable for any damage incurred by the Customer as a result of a failure to acquaint itself with an email from the Company, e.g. because the email sent by the Company was delivered to the Customer&rsquo;s spam folder. The Customer is responsible for checking all its email folders, as well as maintaining sufficient email capacity.</p>
        
        <p>11.11. The Company is not liable for damage arising as a result of an outage of the system of electronic records of sales or any other failure, either partial or complete, of the system of electronic records of sales on the part of the competent authorities.</p>
        
        <p>11.12. The Company is not liable for the compatibility of the Software Product with the Customer&rsquo;s hardware and software equipment in the event that the Customer does not use hardware supplied by the Company or certified for the use of the Software Product and/or does not comply with the instructions given by the Company or the relevant manufacturer of the goods.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>12. DURATION OF THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP FOR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS</p>
        
        <p>12.1. The Licensing Agreement is always concluded for a fixed period of one calendar month unless otherwise specified by the Parties. In the event that the Company plans, because of technological changes and expansion or changes in the Products provided by the Company, to cease offering a specific type of Software Product which the Customer uses, the Company informs the Customer thereof 3 (three) months prior to doing so. If possible, the Company will offer the Customer an alternative Software Product which the Company continues to support.</p>
        
        <p>12.2. The Customer may be entitled to a discount in the amount determined by the Company, which will be provided to the Customer only on condition that the Customer duly meets all its obligations under the Licensing Agreement and it uses the Software Product at least for the period agreed by the Parties. The agreed period means the period from the first day of the month following the activation of the licence for the Software Product by the Customer until the last day of the calendar month specified on the basis of the date when the licence for the Software Product was ordered by the Customer.</p>
        
        <p>12.3. If the Customer fails to comply with the conditions set out by the Company for providing a discount and/or the Contractual Relationship established by the Licensing Agreement ends before the agreed period for any reason, except for the withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement by the Customer for agreed reasons, the Company will send the Customer an additional bill whereby the Customer will be charged the difference between the full price, as shown in the order without the application of the discount, and the discounted price that was paid by the Customer for a proportion of the agreed period from the first day of the agreed period to the date of termination of the Licensing Agreement. The Customer is under an obligation to pay this difference in price to the Company prior to the date indicated on the relevant invoice.</p>
        
        <p>12.4. The Licensing Agreement is terminated upon the expiry of the period for which the fixed-period Licensing Agreement was concluded if, no later than ten days before the expiration of this agreed period, the Customer sends a written notice to the Company expressing that it is not interested in extending this Licensing Agreement. If the Customer fails to send the notice to the Company in accordance with the previous clause, the Licensing Agreement is always extended for the same period for which the initial Licensing Agreement was concluded (i.e. always for the initially agreed period). In this case, the remaining terms and conditions of the current Licensing Agreement (with respect to the changes in accordance with Art. 12.1 and Art. 13.5 of the GTC) remain unchanged upon withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement for the reasons stated in Art. or unless otherwise provided by the Agreement.</p>
        
        <p>12.5. The Customer is entitled to withdraw from the Licensing Agreement if the Software Product is inoperable for reasons caused exclusively by the Company for a period longer than 30 days.</p>
        
        <p>12.6. The Company is entitled to withdraw from the Licensing Agreement if:</p>
        
        <p>a) the Customer is in default in the payment of the licence fee for the use of the Company&rsquo;s Software Product or other debt to the Company for more than 10 days despite being notified thereof;</p>
        
        <p>b) the Customer provided false information when concluding the Licensing Agreement;</p>
        
        <p>c) the Customer failed to provide the assistance to the Company that was required for the proper fulfilment of the Licensing Agreement;</p>
        
        <p>d) another person uses the Software Product during a time when the Customer failed to obtain the prior written consent of the Company thereto;</p>
        
        <p>e) the Customer uses or distributes tools that could threaten the security, functionality or integrity of the Software Product;</p>
        
        <p>f) the Customer otherwise seriously breaches the Licensing Agreement or the present GTC;</p>
        
        <p>g) the Customer has entered into liquidation, faces opened or ongoing insolvency proceedings, has been placed under receivership or is subject to enforcement of a decision or distrainment by selling its business.</p>
        
        <p>12.7. The withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement is valid only ex nunc, i.e. the Parties do not return services rendered or payments made prior to the withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement. So as to avoid doubt, it is established that the withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement does not relieve the Customer, in particular, of its obligation to pay the Company the cost of the licence that was provided to the Software Product (or, if applicable, the price for the proportional part thereof for the period up to the date of the early termination of the Agreement by a notice of termination or withdrawal; in the event of withdrawal from the Licensing Agreement except for a withdrawal for causes under Art. 12.5 of the present GTC, the Customer is not entitled to a discount which the Customer would be entitled to if the Agreement lasted at least for the period agreed by the Parties, i.e. in such a case the Customer is under an obligation to pay the Company the difference in the price of the licence invoiced in accordance with Art. 12.3 of the present GTC), including interest on late payments, if any.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>13. FINAL PROVISIONS</p>
        
        <p>13.1. In the event that any provision of the present GTC is or becomes invalid, unenforceable or null, such invalidity, unenforceability or nullity will not cause the invalidity, unenforceability or nullity of the remaining provisions of the GTC.</p>
        
        <p>13.2. The present GTC come into force and take effect on the date of their issue.</p>
        
        <p>13.3. All information relating to the Software Products, GTC or the Price List will be made available to the Customer at the contact points of the Company or its partners, on the Company website or in a different appropriate manner.</p>
        
        <p>13.4. The Parties agree that the GTC may be amended or supplemented by the Company unilaterally, in particular as a result of changes in legislation, technological changes affecting, for example, the communication with customers and/or the manner of the conclusion, amendment and termination of the Licensing Agreement, but also as a result of extensions or changes to the Products provided by the Company. The Company is also entitled to unilaterally change the GTC if the market conditions or the terms and conditions or licensing conditions of trading partners with whom the Company collaborates and whose services the Company uses to provide services to the Customer change.</p>
        
        <p>13.5. The Customer will be informed about the amendment and/or supplementation of the GTC on the Company website, through the Customer&rsquo;s customer account accessible on the Company&rsquo;s web interface and/or by email, if an email address was provided when the Licensing Agreement was concluded, at least 7 (seven) days prior to the date of the coming into effect of the amendment or supplementation of the GTC. This amendment or supplementation will not affect the rights and obligations of the Parties arising during the period of validity of the previous version of the GTC. The Customer has the right to refuse the amendment or supplementation of the GTC and, on the basis of this reason, terminate the Licensing Agreement in writing before the date of the coming into effect of the revised and/or supplemented GTC at the latest. In the event that the Customer does not exercise this right before the date of the coming into effect of the revised and/or supplemented GTC, it is assumed that it has expressed its consent to the content of the amended or supplemented GTC. The price of the licence for the Software Product for the agreed duration of the Agreement cannot be unilaterally increased on the basis of an amendment to the GTC. The price adjustment becomes effective as of the start of the new period of validity of the Agreement in accordance with 12.4.</p>
        
        <p>13.6. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Company is entitled to communicate amendments to the GTC made in favour of the Customer in a manner set forth in Art. 13.5 of the present GTC even within a period shorter than the period specified in the given article and that amendments that are not to the detriment of the Customer do not give rise to the right to terminate the Licensing Agreement in accordance with Art. 13.5 of the present GTC.</p>
        
        <p>13.7. The Parties exclude the possibility that, beyond the scope of the express provisions of the Licensing Agreement, any of the rights and obligations are drawn from practice established by the Parties or from generally accepted commercial practices relating to the subject matter of the Licensing Agreement.</p>
        
        <p>13.8. The Parties agree to a limitation period for the rights arising from the Licensing Agreement to the benefit of the Company of ten (10) years from the day on which the right could be exercised for the first time.</p>
        
        <p>13.9. The Parties agree that any rights or obligations under the Licensing Agreement or the Licensing Agreement in its entirety may be assigned or transferred to a third party by the Company, to which the Customer expresses its prior consent. The Customer may assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under the Licensing Agreement or the Licensing Agreement in its entirety to a third party only with the prior written consent of the Company.</p>
        
        <p>13.10. The Company is entitled to unilaterally set off all claims against the Customer, including non-mature claims.</p>
        
        <p>13.11. If the Company fails to exercise any of its rights arising from the Licensing Agreement or it exercises only a part thereof or with a delay, this does not have the effect of a waiver of such a right and any partial exercise of such a right does not prevent its other or further exercise or the exercise of any other right, unless otherwise provided in applicable legal regulations.</p>
        
        <p>13.12. The present GTC do not affect the applicable provisions of the copyright legislation, or other legislation governing the use of computer programs and databases, or penalties for their illegal use set forth in this legislation.</p>
