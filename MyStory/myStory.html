<pre class="para1">
    A little boy growing up, in a place surrounded by vibrant colors, a place where every picture was drawn, a place where fantasies were depicted, and a place where this boy learned, explored, and burnt his incandescent imagination to create something which the world has never seen before.    

    Welcome to my world! I'm Ahmad Hassan, a boy whose journey is driven by a relentless curiosity to explore, learn, and make a difference. The exhilarating tapestry of my experiences, challenges faced, and triumphs shaped the person I am today.

<p class="title2">Unveiling the Canvas  </p>
<pre class="para2">
    Born in Mandi Bahauddin, I opened my eyes in a place where peoples’ bread and butter was ink and paper; the Technology, Graphics, and Artwork press market. These early influences sparked a flame within me, igniting a lifelong passion for art, designing and developing modern technologies, within seizing the opportunity to paint my own unique strokes on the canvas of life.

<p class="title3">The Odyssey Begins  </p>
<pre class="para3">
    In my early life, I held a great interest in logical reasoning. I had drawers and boxes filled with wires, motors, parts, and circuits, combining to innovate new things. This early interest of mine led me to the achievement of winning 3 consecutive science fairs and standing up 1st for 6 times. At the time just in 5th grade, I made up my mind to be a Software Engineer. Therefore, my hunger for achieving my aim kept me forever grinding.

    Completing my Matriculation degree, I took my admission to F.Sc. Pre-Engineering and entered the realm of fundamental engineering. During my college life, I was bestowed with “Galaxy of Toppers” 2 times.

The journey to accomplishing my dream has taken me across countless cities, consequently getting admission to Air University, Islamabad. Along with providing me with a platform to forge new paths in this university, I've worn many hats, from designers to innovators, and each role of mine still weaves a new thread into the tapestry of my story, adding depth, and dimension to the vibrant picture that will always continue to evolve.

<p class="title4">Tracing the Origins of Passion </p>
<pre class="para4">
    Within my interest in Software and Creative Technologies, I extended my grip on writing skills i.e. (Creative, Academic, and Story writing), Artwork skills i.e. (sketching, digital art, and gesture), and became proficient in programs like CorelDraw, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Inpage Professional, and other graphic editing software. My fondness for photography also developed a significant sense of aesthetics in me, which was hidden from this world until I won the provincial Photography Contest.

    For the peace of my heart, I love profound reading. I’ve finished books of various genres including programming, personal development, horror, thriller and fantasy; considering and making them my best companion. But there were also the times sitting in the depths of solitude, amidst the silence, my soul found its voice, and from the shadows emerged a symphony of written words; leaving me alone to write quotes and ponder about the purpose of life within diving into the philosophical world.

       Flowing in the harmony of time, I soon realized the ability of mine to recognize music motivated me to get recognition in Rap, and my dedication to it let me win many Rap contents and perform in various concerts.</pre>
