    A little boy growing up, in a place surrounded by vibrant colors, a place where every picture was drawn, a place where fantasies were depicted, and a place where this boy learned, explored, and burnt his incandescent imagination to create something which the world has never seen before.    

    Welcome to my world! I'm Ahmad Hassan, a boy whose journey is driven by a relentless curiosity to explore, learn, and make a difference. The exhilarating tapestry of my experiences, challenges faced, and triumphs shaped the person I am today.

<pre class="para2">
    Born in Mandi Bahauddin, I opened my eyes in a place where peoples’ bread and butter was ink and paper; the Technology, Graphics, and Artwork press market. These early influences sparked a flame within me, igniting a lifelong passion for art, designing and developing modern technologies, within seizing the opportunity to paint my own unique strokes on the canvas of life.

<p class="title3">The Odyssey Begins  </p>
<pre class="para3">
    In my early life, I held a great interest in logical reasoning. I had drawers and boxes filled with wires, motors, parts, and circuits, combining to innovate new things. This early interest of mine led me to the achievement of winning 3 consecutive science fairs and standing up 1st for 6 times. At the time just in 5th grade, I made up my mind to be a Software Engineer. Therefore, my hunger for achieving my aim kept me forever grinding.

    Completing my Matriculation degree, I took my admission to F.Sc. Pre-Engineering and entered the realm of fundamental engineering. During my college life, I was bestowed with “Galaxy of Toppers” 2 times.

The journey to accomplishing my dream has taken me across countless cities, consequently getting admission to Air University, Islamabad. Along with providing me with a platform to forge new paths in this university, I've worn many hats, from designers to innovators, and each role of mine still weaves a new thread into the tapestry of my story, adding depth, and dimension to the vibrant picture that will always continue to evolve.
